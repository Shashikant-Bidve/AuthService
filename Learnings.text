Start point :
Design LLD & HLD for api and DB

Code start:
1.) initialize grade springboot project
2.) install dependencies
3.) start from defining entities, then creating services (business logic), repository (perform CRUD operations and custom queries), models (DTO used for request, response)



Learnings :
Filters are similar to middlewares (act on HTTPServelet request before becoming HTTP request)
